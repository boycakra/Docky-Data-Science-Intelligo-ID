Machine Learning Competition README
Overview
This document outlines the rules and guidelines for the Machine Learning competition in the context of supervised learning and data management.

Competition Type
The competition follows a supervised learning approach, where participants are tasked with building a model based on labeled data.

Data Management
Five data files are provided for training purposes. Participants are responsible for labeling the data according to the given task and ensuring label quality.

Training and Testing Process
Participants are required to train a machine learning model using the labeled training data. After training, testing should be conducted on the provided data to evaluate the model's performance.

Results Submission
Participants must submit their results in the specified format, following the structure demonstrated in the provided sample_submission example.

Final Evaluation
Evaluation Metric
The primary evaluation metric for this competition is accuracy. Accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions using the formula:

accuracy
=
number of correct predictions
total number of predictions
accuracy= 
total number of predictions
number of correct predictions
