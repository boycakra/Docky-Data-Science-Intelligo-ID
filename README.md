Machine Learning Competition README
Overview
This document outlines the rules and guidelines for the Machine Learning competition in the context of supervised learning and data management.

Competition Type
The competition follows a supervised learning approach, where participants are tasked with building a model based on labeled data.

Data Management
Five data files are provided for training purposes. Participants are responsible for labeling the data according to the given task and ensuring label quality.

Training and Testing Process
Participants are required to train a machine learning model using the labeled training data. After training, testing should be conducted on the provided data to evaluate the model's performance.

Results Submission
Participants must submit their results in the specified format, following the structure demonstrated in the provided sample_submission example.

Final Evaluation
Evaluation Metric
The primary evaluation metric for this competition is accuracy. Accuracy is calculated by dividing the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions using the formula:

accuracy
=
number of correct predictions
total number of predictions
accuracy= 
total number of predictions
number of correct predictions

Code and Method Explanation
To address the specific problem presented in this competition, the following steps were taken in the implementation:

1. Data Preprocessing:
Conversion of relevant columns to datetime format:
python
Copy code
result['order_delivered_timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(result['order_delivered_timestamp'])
result['order_estimated_delivery_date'] = pd.to_datetime(result['order_estimated_delivery_date'])
result['is_late'] = (result['order_delivered_timestamp'] > result['order_estimated_delivery_date']).astype(int)
This step ensures that time-related columns are in the proper datetime format.
2. Feature Selection:
Selection of relevant features:
python
Copy code
features = ['customer_zip_code_prefix', 'price', 'shipping_charges',
            'payment_sequential', 'payment_installments', 'payment_value',
            'product_weight_g', 'product_length_cm', 'product_height_cm',
            'product_width_cm']
X = result[features]
y = result['is_late']
Identified features crucial for predicting the target variable 'is_late'.
3. Handling Missing Values:
Utilization of SimpleImputer:
python
Copy code
imputer = SimpleImputer(strategy='mean')
X = imputer.fit_transform(X)
Missing values in selected features were handled using the SimpleImputer from scikit-learn with a mean imputation strategy.
4. Model Training:
Implementation of RandomForestClassifier:
python
Copy code
clf = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)
clf.fit(X, y)
A RandomForestClassifier was chosen for its effectiveness in classification tasks. The classifier was trained using the labeled training data ('X' features and 'y' target variable).
This process ensures that the model is trained on relevant features, accounting for missing values, and utilizing a RandomForestClassifier for the classification task. The resulting model is then ready for testing and evaluation on new data.
