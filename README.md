Machine Learning Competition Readme
Overview
This document provides specific rules and guidelines related to Machine Learning in the context of supervised learning and data handling for this competition.

Competition Type
This competition adopts a supervised learning approach. Participants are expected to build a model based on labeled data.

Data Management
Five data files are provided for training. Participants are responsible for labeling the data according to the given task and ensuring the quality of the labels.

Training and Testing Process
Participants must train a machine learning model using the labeled training data. After training, participants are required to test the model on the provided data to evaluate its performance.

Results Submission
Participants must submit their results in the specified format, as demonstrated in the provided sample_submission example.

Final Evaluation
Evaluation Metric
The primary evaluation metric for this competition is accuracy. Accuracy is calculated as the number of correct predictions divided by the total number of predictions.
